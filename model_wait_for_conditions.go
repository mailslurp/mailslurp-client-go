import (

// WaitForConditions Conditions that a `waitForXEmails` endpoint operates on. The methods wait until given conditions are met or a timeout is reached. If the conditions are met without needing to wait the results will be returned immediately. Can include `unreadOnly` to ignore already read emails that were returned in an API call or viewing in the dashboard. Can also include matches for emails containing `from`, `subject`, `hasAttachments` etc.
type WaitForConditions struct {
	// ISO Date Time latest time of email to consider. Filter for matching emails that were received before this date
	Before time.Time `json:"before,omitempty"`
	// Number of results that should match conditions. Either exactly or at least this amount based on the `countType`. If count condition is not met and the timeout has not been reached the `waitFor` method will retry the operation.
	Count int32 `json:"count,omitempty"`
	// How should the found count be compared to the expected count.
	CountType string `json:"countType,omitempty"`
	// Max time in milliseconds to wait between retries if a `timeout` is specified.
	DelayTimeout int64 `json:"delayTimeout,omitempty"`
	// ID of inbox to search within and apply conditions to. Essentially filtering the emails found to give a count.
	InboxId string `json:"inboxId"`
	// Conditions that should be matched for an email to qualify for results. Each condition will be applied in order to each email within an inbox to filter a result list of matching emails you are waiting for.
	Matches []MatchOption `json:"matches,omitempty"`
	// ISO Date Time earliest time of email to consider. Filter for matching emails that were received after this date
	Since time.Time `json:"since,omitempty"`
	// Direction to sort matching emails by created time
	SortDirection string `json:"sortDirection,omitempty"`
	// Max time in milliseconds to retry the `waitFor` operation until conditions are met.
	Timeout int64 `json:"timeout"`
	// Apply conditions only to **unread** emails. All emails begin with `read=false`. An email is marked `read=true` when an `EmailDto` representation of it has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called `getEmail` or `waitForLatestEmail` etc., or you have viewed the email in the dashboard.
	UnreadOnly bool `json:"unreadOnly,omitempty"`
