package mailslurp
// MatchOption Options for matching emails in an inbox. Each match option object contains a `field`, `should` and `value` property. Together they form logical conditions such as `SUBJECT` should `CONTAIN` value.
type MatchOption struct {
	// The email property to match on. One of SUBJECT, TO, BCC, CC or FROM
	Field string `json:"field,omitempty"`
	// What criteria to apply. CONTAIN or EQUAL. Note CONTAIN is recommended due to some SMTP servers adding new lines to fields and body content.
	Should string `json:"should,omitempty"`
	// The value you wish to compare with the value of the field specified using the `should` value passed. For example `BODY` should `CONTAIN` a value passed.
	Value string `json:"value,omitempty"`
